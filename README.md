# HBus

## Introduction

HBus is a wired home automation interface. Nodes made as simple and as cheap as possible. Minimum requirement - Arduino Pro Mini (Atmega 328P) with 78L05 regulator and a CAN transciever. Wiring made by Cat5/Cat6 cables. One twisted pair used for HBus communication, two twisted pairs distribute 12V power to HBus nodes, one pair left unused. 

## Basic principles

  * UART with CAN transceivers, dominant/recessive states.
  * Baud rate 19.2 kbps
  * CSMA/CD or CSMA/CA, see description.
  * CRC-16-CCITT.
  * Flow control by byte-stuffing.
  * Two modes of operation:
    * Configuration, point-to-point messages, master/slave communication model - HBus mode.
    * Operation, broadcast messages, producer/consumer communication model - MQTT mode.

## CAN driver restrictions

Many CAN drivers has embedded mechanism to prevent long dominant state. If dominant state lasts longer than a pre-defined time-out, driver automatically goes into recessive state. Bit interval is 52.08 us at baud rate of 19.2 kbps. Start bit and a data byte of 0x00 produce dominant state for 9 bit-intervals, or for 0.47 ms. The following CAN transceivers are suitable for HBus: 
  * MCP2542 -	dominant state 0.8 ms min
  * TJA1057 -	dominant state 0.8 ms min
  * NCV7342 - dominant state 1.3 ms min
  * NCV7351 - dominant state 1.5 ms min
  * TLE7250V - dominant state 4.5 ms min
  * MCP2551 - dominant state 1.25 ms min, slope control
  * ADM3054 - no limit, isolated
  * IFX1050GVIO - no limit
  * SN65HVD230 - no limit, slope control
  * L9615 - no limit, slope control
  * PCA82C250 - no limit, slope control
Transcevers with slope control produce less noise on the bus, ie offer metter EMI.

## Byte-stuffing

Code 0x1B (eg ESC symbol) marks the beginning of a 2-byte sequence. The following byte pairs are defined: 

  * 0x1B-0x02 	- start of HBus frame 
  * 0x1B-0x03 	- start of MQTT-SN frame
  * 0x1B-0x07 	- end of frame 
  * 0x1B-0x08 	- insert 0x1B into data flow
  * 0x1B-0x09 	- insert 0x1B, 0x1B into data flow
